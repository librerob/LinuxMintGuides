# BTRFS + LUKS2 Installation Guide (BIOS & Root-Only Encryption)
### Linux Mint / Ubuntu Derivatives — Ubiquity installer — BIOS/GPT — Timeshift snapshots + grml-rescueboot

> **Based on** [mutschler.dev's Ubuntu 20.04 btrfs guide](https://mutschler.dev/linux/ubuntu-btrfs-20-04/), adapted for:
> - **LUKS2** with Argon2id key derivation instead of LUKS1
> - **Root-only encryption** — `/boot` is a separate unencrypted partition, which is what makes LUKS2 possible
> - **BIOS/GPT** boot instead of UEFI
> - **6 GiB `/boot` partition** — sized to accommodate a live ISO for [grml-rescueboot](https://github.com/grml/grml-rescueboot)
> - **Mount options:** `defaults,compress=zstd:1`

---

## Overview

This guide installs Linux Mint or other Ubuntu-based derivatives with the following disk structure:

- A **1 MiB unformatted BIOS boot partition** — required by GRUB when using GPT on a BIOS system; GRUB writes its core image here
- An **unencrypted 6 GiB ext4 `/boot` partition** — kept large enough to store a live ISO for grml-rescueboot, which lets you boot into a live environment directly from GRUB and use it to restore Timeshift snapshots on an encrypted system
- A **LUKS2 encrypted partition** for the root btrfs filesystem, containing:
  - Subvolume `@` mounted at `/`
  - Subvolume `@home` mounted at `/home`
- Automatic system snapshots using [Timeshift](https://github.com/linuxmint/timeshift), with rollback done by booting the live ISO via grml-rescueboot
- **zram** for swap instead of a swap partition or swapfile

### Why GPT instead of MBR on a BIOS system?

GPT is more robust than MBR — it supports more partitions, has redundant partition tables, and is the modern standard even on BIOS machines. GRUB supports GPT on BIOS systems perfectly well, but requires a small dedicated 1 MiB BIOS boot partition where it can embed its core image (since there is no MBR gap large enough on GPT disks). This is standard practice and has no downsides.

### Why LUKS2 instead of LUKS1?

The GRUB bootloader shipped with Linux Mint and Ubuntu cannot decrypt LUKS2 partitions. The original mutschler.dev guide works around this by using LUKS1, which GRUB does understand. This guide takes a different approach: by placing `/boot` on its own unencrypted partition, GRUB never needs to touch LUKS at all. It reads the kernel and initramfs directly from the unencrypted `/boot`, and then the initramfs handles decrypting the LUKS2 root partition before handing control to the OS. This means:

- LUKS2 is fully supported with no GRUB limitations to work around
- Argon2id key derivation is used instead of LUKS1's PBKDF2, which is far more resistant to brute-force attacks
- GRUB configuration is simpler — no `GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK` required

The only tradeoff is that the contents of `/boot` (your kernel and initramfs) are readable by someone with physical access to the drive. For the vast majority of users this is an acceptable tradeoff, and the stronger LUKS2 encryption on root more than compensates.

### Why a 6 GiB `/boot`?

A typical `/boot` partition only needs a few hundred megabytes for kernels and initramfs files. We size it at 6 GiB here to leave room for a live rescue ISO (such as a Mint or Grml ISO) used by [grml-rescueboot](https://github.com/grml/grml-rescueboot). grml-rescueboot adds a GRUB entry that boots directly from an ISO file placed in `/boot/grml/`, giving you a fully working live environment from which you can unlock your LUKS2 partition, mount your btrfs subvolumes, and restore a Timeshift snapshot — without needing a separate USB drive.

### Compatibility

This guide uses the **Ubiquity installer**, which is the default installer in:

- Linux Mint 21.x and 22.x
- Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) — the original basis for this guide
- Ubuntu derivatives that still ship Ubiquity, such as older versions of Pop!_OS and Zorin OS

> **Note:** Ubuntu switched from Ubiquity to the new Flutter-based installer starting with Ubuntu 23.04, and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS ships the new installer by default. This guide does **not** apply to those versions. For plain Ubuntu, this guide is best suited to **20.04** and should work on **22.04**, but is not tested on 23.04 or later. Linux Mint 21.x and 22.x still use Ubiquity and are fully supported.

## Step 0: General Remarks

**Strongly recommended: test this entire procedure in a virtual machine before running it on real hardware.**

You can use any VM software (VirtualBox, GNOME Boxes, virt-manager, etc.) with a 64 GB virtual disk and 4+ GB RAM to follow along safely. Make sure the VM is configured to boot in **BIOS mode** (not UEFI).

Boot your installation USB in **BIOS mode**. This guide covers BIOS only. If your machine offers a choice between UEFI and Legacy/BIOS boot, choose Legacy/BIOS.

---

## Step 1: Boot the Install, Check BIOS Mode, and Open a Root Shell

Boot your installation USB, choose your language, and click **Try** (not "Install"). Once the live desktop has loaded, open a terminal with `Ctrl+Alt+T`.

If you have a non-English keyboard layout, set it first: go to **Settings → Region & Language** and configure your keyboard before continuing.

Verify you are booted in BIOS mode (there should be no efivars mount):

```bash
mount | grep efivars
# (no output — expected on a BIOS system)
```

If the command returns no output, you are in BIOS mode and can proceed. Now switch to an interactive root session:

```bash
sudo -i
```

Keep this terminal open for the entire installation. Do not close it until we are completely finished.

---

## Step 2: Prepare Partitions Manually

### Identify Your Target Disk

```bash
lsblk
# NAME  MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
# loop0   7:0    0   1.9G  1 loop /rofs
# ...
# nvme1n1   252:0    0    64G  0 disk
```

You can also open GParted or look in `/dev` to confirm. Common disk names are `sda` for SATA SSDs and HDDs, and `nvme0n1` for NVMe drives.

**Replace `nvme1n1` with your actual disk name in every command throughout this guide.**

### Create Partition Table and Layout

We will create 3 partitions:

| # | Size | Role | Filesystem |
|---|------|------|------------|
| nvme1n1p1 | 1 MiB | BIOS boot partition (for GRUB) | none |
| nvme1n1p2 | 6 GiB | `/boot` (unencrypted, holds rescue ISO) | ext4 |
| nvme1n1p3 | remainder | LUKS2 encrypted root | btrfs inside LUKS2 |

```bash
parted /dev/nvme1n1
  mklabel gpt
  mkpart primary 1MiB 2MiB
  set 1 bios_grub on
  mkpart primary 2MiB 6146MiB
  mkpart primary 6146MiB 100%
  print
  quit
```

Your output should look something like:

```
Number  Start     End       Size    File system  Name     Flags
 1      1049kB    2097kB    1049kB               primary  bios_grub
 2      2097kB    6443MB    6441MB               primary
 3      6443MB    68.7GB    62.3GB               primary
```

> The `bios_grub` flag on partition 1 is essential — it marks the partition as the GRUB embedding area and prevents other tools from trying to use it.

> **Do not set partition names beyond the bios_grub flag.** The Ubiquity installer has known issues with named GPT partitions and may fail or behave unexpectedly.

### Create the LUKS2 Encrypted Partition

```bash
cryptsetup luksFormat --type=luks2 \
  --pbkdf argon2id \
  --iter-time 4000 \
  /dev/nvme1n1p3
# WARNING!
# ========
# This will overwrite data on /dev/nvme1n1p3 irrevocably.
# Are you sure? (Type uppercase yes): YES
# Enter passphrase for /dev/nvme1n1p3:
# Verify passphrase:
```

Use a strong passphrase. The flags explained:

- `--type=luks2` — use LUKS version 2
- `--pbkdf argon2id` — use Argon2id key derivation, which is memory-hard and far more resistant to GPU-based brute-force than LUKS1's PBKDF2
- `--iter-time 4000` — spend ~4 seconds deriving the key (default is ~2 seconds), making offline brute-force attacks twice as expensive. Since you only type this passphrase once at boot, the extra 2 seconds is not noticeable in practice.

Now open (unlock) the encrypted partition and map it to a name we can use:

```bash
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/nvme1n1p3 cryptdata
# Enter passphrase for /dev/nvme1n1p3:

ls /dev/mapper/
# control  cryptdata
```

### Create Filesystems

```bash
# /boot partition — unencrypted ext4
mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme1n1p2

# Root btrfs filesystem inside the LUKS2 container
mkfs.btrfs /dev/mapper/cryptdata
```

> The BIOS boot partition (nvme1n1p1) is left unformatted intentionally — GRUB writes its own data there directly.

We pre-format `cryptdata` as btrfs now because the Ubiquity installer can complain about unmounted devices otherwise.

---

## Step 3 (Optional): Optimize btrfs Mount Options Before Installing

The Ubiquity installer does not write optimal btrfs mount options. We pre-edit two files in the live environment so the correct options end up in the installed system's `/etc/fstab`.

We use `defaults,compress=zstd:1` as our mount options. `zstd:1` means zstd compression at level 1 — fast, effective, and low on CPU overhead.

Edit the first file:

```bash
xed /usr/lib/partman/mount.d/70btrfs
```

> Enable line numbers in xed via **View → Show Line Numbers** for easier navigation.

Find and update these two lines (around lines 24 and 31):

```bash
# line 24:
options="${options:+$options,}subvol=@,defaults,compress=zstd:1"

# line 31:
options="${options:+$options,}subvol=@home,defaults,compress=zstd:1"
```

> If the lines don't match, use `Ctrl+F` in xed to search for `subvol=@` to locate them.

Edit the second file:

```bash
xed /usr/lib/partman/fstab.d/btrfs
```

Update these lines:

```bash
# line 30: pass=0
# line 31: home_options="${options:+$options,}subvol=@home,defaults,compress=zstd:1"
# line 32: options="${options:+$options,}subvol=@,defaults,compress=zstd:1"
# line 36: pass=0
# line 37: options="${options:+$options,}subvol=@home,defaults,compress=zstd:1"
# line 40: pass=0
# line 56: echo "$home_path" "$home_mp" btrfs "$home_options" 0 0
```

> If the lines don't match, use `Ctrl+F` in xed to search for `subvol=@` to locate them.

> **OBS:** There is a known Ubuntu/Mint bug where modifying the partman scripts can sometimes cause Ubiquity to fail mid-install. It is not common, but it does happen. The safe fallback is to skip Step 3 entirely, let the installer finish, and then correct the mount options manually in `/etc/fstab` during Step 5 in the chroot.

---

## Step 4: Install Using the Ubiquity Installer (Without Bootloader)

Run the installer with the `--no-bootloader` flag. We skip the bootloader here because we will install and configure GRUB manually in the chroot after the install completes:

```bash
ubiquity --no-bootloader
```

Work through the language, keyboard, and installation type screens as normal. When you reach **Installation Type**, choose **Something Else** to open the manual partitioner.

Assign partitions as follows:

- Select **`/dev/nvme1n1p1`** — leave it completely alone, do not assign a mount point or format it
- Select **`/dev/nvme1n1p2`** → press **Change** → set **Use as**: `ext4 journaling filesystem`, check **Format the partition**, set **Mount point**: `/boot`
- Select **`/dev/mapper/cryptdata`** (shown as type btrfs) → press **Change** → set **Use as**: `btrfs journaling filesystem`, check **Format the partition**, set **Mount point**: `/`

> Ubiquity will create a swapfile automatically since we have no swap partition. We will remove it in the next step and replace it with zram.

Double-check your partition assignments, press **Install Now**, and confirm the changes. Fill in your timezone, username, and password. When the installer finishes, choose **Continue Testing** — **do not reboot yet**.

---

## Step 5: Post-Installation Steps

### Create a chroot Environment and Enter Your System

Return to your root terminal and mount the newly installed system:

```bash
mount -o subvol=@,defaults,compress=zstd:1 /dev/mapper/cryptdata /mnt
```

Bind-mount the virtual filesystems:

```bash
for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done
```

Copy DNS configuration so the chroot has network access:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/
```

Enter the chroot:

```bash
sudo chroot /mnt
```

You are now operating inside your newly installed system. Mount all remaining partitions and verify:

```bash
mount -av
# /                        : ignored
# /boot                    : successfully mounted
# /home                    : successfully mounted
# none                     : ignored
```

> Note: there is no `/boot/efi` entry here — that is UEFI only.

Check the btrfs subvolumes:

```bash
btrfs subvolume list /
# ID 256 gen 164 top level 5 path @
# ID 258 gen 30 top level 5 path @home
```

### Remove the Installer Swapfile

Ubiquity created a swapfile since we skipped the swap partition. Remove it — we will use zram instead:

```bash
swapoff /swapfile
rm /swapfile
sed -i '\|^/swapfile|d' /etc/fstab
```

### Verify /etc/fstab

```bash
cat /etc/fstab
```

You should see entries along these lines:

```
/dev/mapper/cryptdata  /         btrfs  defaults,subvol=@,compress=zstd:1      0  0
/dev/mapper/cryptdata  /home     btrfs  defaults,subvol=@home,compress=zstd:1  0  0
UUID=xxxx-xxxx         /boot     ext4   defaults                                0  2
```

If the mount options are wrong, correct them now:

```bash
nano /etc/fstab
```

### Create crypttab

The `crypttab` file tells the initramfs which LUKS partitions to unlock at boot:

```bash
export UUIDNVME=$(blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/nvme1n1p3)
echo "cryptdata UUID=${UUIDNVME} none luks" >> /etc/crypttab

cat /etc/crypttab
# cryptdata UUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx none luks
```

> **Important:** The UUID must be from `/dev/nvme1n1p3` (the LUKS container), not from `/dev/mapper/cryptdata` (the unlocked device inside it). You can list all UUIDs with `blkid`. The `luks` option works correctly with both LUKS1 and LUKS2.

### Install the BIOS Bootloader

On a BIOS/GPT system, GRUB installs directly to the disk — not to an EFI directory. We target the disk itself, not a partition:

```bash
grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/nvme1n1
```

> **Important:** Target the whole disk (`/dev/nvme1n1`), not a partition (`/dev/nvme1n1p1`). GRUB will automatically find and use the BIOS boot partition flagged with `bios_grub`.

> **Troubleshooting:** If you get an error about missing GRUB modules, install the BIOS GRUB package and retry:
> ```bash
> apt install grub-pc
> ```

> **Note:** You do **not** need `GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y` in `/etc/default/grub`. That setting is only required when `/boot` itself lives inside a LUKS container. Here, GRUB reads `/boot` from the plain ext4 partition and never interacts with LUKS at all.

Update GRUB:

```bash
update-grub
```

Rebuild the initramfs so it picks up the crypttab configuration:

```bash
update-initramfs -u -k all
```

---

## Step 6: Reboot, Checks, and Update

Exit the chroot:

```bash
exit
```

Unmount everything cleanly:

```bash
for i in /dev/pts /dev /proc /sys /run; do sudo umount /mnt$i; done
sudo umount /mnt/boot
sudo umount /mnt/home
sudo umount /mnt
```

Reboot:

```bash
reboot
```

At boot you will be prompted once by the initramfs to enter your LUKS2 passphrase. After entering it, the system boots normally into your desktop.

### Verify the Setup

Once logged in, open a terminal and run these checks:

```bash
# Confirm LUKS2 is in use
sudo cryptsetup status cryptdata
# type:    LUKS2   ← should say LUKS2

# Confirm Argon2id key derivation
sudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/nvme1n1p3 | grep -E "Version|PBKDF"
# Version:        2
# PBKDF:          argon2id

# Check btrfs subvolumes
sudo btrfs subvolume list /
# ID 256 gen ... path @
# ID 258 gen ... path @home

# Check mount options
findmnt -t btrfs

# Confirm partition layout
lsblk -f
# nvme1n1p1                        ← BIOS boot partition (no filesystem)
# nvme1n1p2   ext4         /boot   ← unencrypted ext4
# nvme1n1p3   crypto_LUKS          ← LUKS2 container
```

### Update the System

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

---

## Step 7: Set Up zram Swap

Instead of a swap partition or swapfile, we use **zram** — a compressed RAM-based block device used as swap. It is faster than disk swap, uses no disk space, and works perfectly with btrfs snapshots since there is nothing on the filesystem to worry about.

Install the zram-config package:

```bash
sudo apt install zram-tools
```

Configure it by editing `/etc/default/zramswap`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/zramswap
```

Recommended configuration:

```ini
# Compression algorithm
# speed: lz4 > zstd > lzo
# compression: zstd > lzo > lz4
ALGO=zstd

# Percentage of total RAM to use for zram
# This takes precedence over SIZE below
PERCENT=25

# Static size in MiB (used if PERCENT is not set)
#SIZE=256

# Swap priority — higher number = higher priority
# Should be higher than any disk/SSD swap
PRIORITY=100
```

Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable zramswap
sudo systemctl start zramswap
```

Verify it is active:

```bash
swapon --show
# NAME       TYPE      SIZE  USED PRIO
# /dev/zram0 partition ...   ...   100
```

---

## Step 8: Btrfs Maintenance & SSD Trimming

We use `btrfsmaintenance` to automate scrub, balance and trim via systemd timers — no cron jobs or custom scripts needed. It handles multiple drives from a single config file.

```bash
sudo apt install btrfsmaintenance
```

### Configure

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/btrfsmaintenance
```

Find and update these lines:

```ini
# Automatically detect and maintain all mounted btrfs filesystems
BTRFS_BALANCE_MOUNTPOINTS="auto"
BTRFS_SCRUB_MOUNTPOINTS="auto"
BTRFS_TRIM_MOUNTPOINTS="auto"

# How often to balance
BTRFS_BALANCE_PERIOD="weekly"

# How often to scrub
BTRFS_SCRUB_PERIOD="monthly"

# How often to trim
BTRFS_TRIM_PERIOD="weekly"
```

Using `auto` means btrfsmaintenance will detect and cover all mounted btrfs filesystems automatically — including any secondary drives — without needing to list them manually. If you ever add another btrfs drive, no config changes are needed.

The defaults for `BTRFS_BALANCE_DUSAGE`, `BTRFS_BALANCE_MUSAGE`, and `BTRFS_SCRUB_PRIORITY` are already sensible — no need to change them.

### Disable fstrim.timer

Linux Mint enables `fstrim.timer` by default. Since we are now managing trim through btrfsmaintenance, disable it to avoid running trim twice:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable fstrim.timer
sudo systemctl stop fstrim.timer
```

### Apply and verify

After saving, reload the timers so the new config takes effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart btrfsmaintenance-refresh.service
```

Verify all timers are scheduled:

```bash
systemctl list-timers | grep btrfs
```

You should see `btrfs-balance.timer`, `btrfs-scrub.timer`, and `btrfs-trim.timer` all listed with upcoming run times.

**What each task does:**

| Task | Frequency | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `btrfs-trim` | Weekly | Tells the SSD which blocks are free (TRIM) — keeps SSD performance healthy |
| `btrfs-scrub` | Monthly | Reads all data and verifies checksums — catches silent data corruption |
| `btrfs-balance` | Weekly | Redistributes chunk allocation — prevents fragmentation over time |

### Run manually anytime

```bash
# Scrub (runs in background, may take a while on large drives)
sudo btrfs scrub start /
sudo btrfs scrub status /   # check progress

# Balance (only touches nearly-empty chunks — fast and non-disruptive)
sudo btrfs balance start -dusage=10 -musage=10 /
```

---

## Step 9: Install Timeshift and grml-rescueboot

### Install Timeshift

```bash
sudo apt install timeshift
```

Open Timeshift from the applications menu and configure it:

- **Snapshot type**: BTRFS
- **Snapshot location**: select your root btrfs partition (`/dev/mapper/cryptdata`)
- Configure a snapshot schedule to your liking (daily, weekly, etc.)
- Click **Create** to take your first manual snapshot and verify everything works

### Install grml-rescueboot

[grml-rescueboot](https://github.com/grml/grml-rescueboot) adds a GRUB menu entry that boots directly from a live ISO stored in `/boot/grml/`. This gives you a fully working live rescue environment accessible from GRUB itself — no USB stick needed. From the live environment you can unlock your LUKS2 partition, mount your btrfs subvolumes, and restore any Timeshift snapshot. This is why we sized `/boot` at 6 GiB — enough to comfortably hold a live ISO alongside your kernels.

```bash
sudo apt install grml-rescueboot
```

Download a live ISO of your choice (a Mint ISO, a Grml ISO, etc.) and place it in `/boot/grml/`:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /boot/grml
# Copy or download your ISO into /boot/grml/
sudo cp /path/to/your.iso /boot/grml/rescue.iso
```

Update GRUB to add the rescue boot entry:

```bash
sudo update-grub
```

Reboot and check your GRUB menu — you should now see a rescue/live entry alongside your normal boot options.

### Restoring a Timeshift Snapshot from the Live Environment

If your system breaks and you need to restore a snapshot:

1. Reboot and select the live ISO entry from the GRUB menu
2. Once the live environment has loaded, open Timeshift (included in Linux Mint live ISOs)
3. When prompted to select a snapshot location, choose your encrypted root disk
4. Enter your LUKS2 passphrase when asked — Timeshift will unlock the partition automatically
5. Select the snapshot you want to restore and click **Restore**
6. Reboot back into your fully working system

> **Note:** On a BIOS system the GRUB menu may appear automatically at boot without needing to hold `Shift`. If it does not, hold `Shift` during boot to bring it up.
